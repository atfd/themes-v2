# Small Victories Default Themes v2

## v2 Philosophy
+ v1 Themes were designed as style-agnostic starting points for customization. v2 Themes are designed using a refined Small Victories theme language so that sites feel finished and considered with no further customization, but aren’t overstyled to the point where customizing is difficult.
+ all Themes share standardized Components, including:
  + design language
  + default files
  + class names
  + HTML structure
  + UI components
+ some themes have Components enabled by default, but any theme will be able to interpet the standard set of components
+ Themes use a widely-adpoted and supported framework (Bootstrap 4) for easy customization
+ `_sv_custom.css` files now have many more helpers included by default to make common customizations easy. For example, these might be things like:
  + changing the background color or typeface of your site
  + hiding the info link
  + changing the width/alignemtn of a text column
+ if I change the `theme:` setting in a site’s `_sv_settings.txt` file, SV will know what to do with content, components, and customizations.
